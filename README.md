## Suggestion Box

In the future, I would like to add the following improvements:

- Add a page that displays what the user answered vs the correct answers for each question.
- Add a functionality that allows users to add their own questions.
- Add a functionality that randomizes the question order.

I'm a big believer in always refactoring code to improve it's functionality. If you would like to suggest your own improvements, you can reach me at the following links.
